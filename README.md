# SchereSteinPapier
SchereSteinPapier is a Rock Paper Scissors simulation, where two players are involved: one who always uses paper and another who uses random hand gestures. 
They play against each other in a game of rock, paper, scissors. This project, which I developed, is part of my employment.
